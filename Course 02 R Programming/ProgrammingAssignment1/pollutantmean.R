# Write a function named 'pollutantmean' that calculates the mean of a pollutant
# (sulfate or nitrate) across a specified list of monitors. The function
# 'pollutantmean' takes three arguments: 'directory', 'pollutant', and 'id'.
# Given a vector monitor ID numbers, 'pollutantmean' reads that monitors'
# particulate matter data from the directory specified in the 'directory'
# argument and returns the mean of the pollutant across all of the monitors,
# ignoring any missing values coded as NA. A prototype of the function is as
# follows



pollutantmean <- function(directory, pollutant, id = 1:332) {
  ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
  ## the location of the CSV files
  
  ## 'pollutant' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
  ## the name of the pollutant for which we will calculate the
  ## mean; either "sulfate" or "nitrate".
  
  ## 'id' is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID numbers
  ## to be used
  
  ## Return the mean of the pollutant across all monitors list
  ## in the 'id' vector (ignoring NA values)
  ## NOTE: Do not round the result!
  
  # Generate a list with full file names
  files_list <- list.files(directory, full.names = TRUE)
  
  # Read defined file names
  data_list <- lapply(files_list[id], read.csv)
  
  # Generate a single dataframe
  data_frame <- do.call(rbind, data_list)
  
  # Calculate Mean for pollutant
  poll_mean <- mean(data_frame[, pollutant], na.rm = TRUE)
  poll_mean
